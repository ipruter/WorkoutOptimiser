# Workout Optimizer
The workout optimizer provides the results of a professionally developed, need specific workout routine without all the math and fine-tuning that would go into one. Users can customize workouts and exercises or use a workout builder that instantly creates a holistic and balanced workout. The workout optimizer is more than a traditional list of daily exorcises. It calculates an appropriate amount of weight or reps replacing a process of trial and error. It also increases (overloads) the weight for any given workout at the click of a button throughout and across workouts as opposed to going through lists and making updates manually. It also factors bodyweight into each lift to maximize the accuracy of weight across various rep ranges. The app is flexible and can adjust reps on its own in cases where there’s a limited precision of weight such as atlas stones or in the case body weight causes limitations. When designed properly, workouts are a technical and tedious process that the app provides all the benefits of with none of the hassle.

You can generate a workout by pressing the quick builder button. 



<img src="https://github.com/ipruter/WorkoutMaker/blob/main/Images/Screenshot_20230604-184226-234.png" height="50%" width="50%" >

On the next screen enter the name of the workout in the top form and select what days of the week you want to work out on.

No matter what the selection is, a workout will be generated that balances core, hindging, lower body push, upper body pull, and upper body push muscle groups. Fewer days selects for a fine ballance of compound exercises to maintain both a high volume and coverage of muscles in a short amount of time. Where as, more days allows for optimal volume with a careful selection of diverse exercises to mitigate risk of injury at the higher volume to maximize coverage. This custome workout can later be edited in case you need to alternate exercises due to a lack of equipment or just as a preference.

You can also create your own workouts from scratch by entering the workout name on the top of the workouts page and tapping the add button. Then eddit, then pick a day of the week.

Select an exercise name in the top form and fill out weight or reps and sets. 

<img src="https://github.com/ipruter/WorkoutMaker/blob/main/Images/Screenshot_20230604-184921-187.png" height="50%" width="50%" >

If an exercise you are looking for is not listed, you can create one under "get max weight" on the homescreen. Upon selecting an exercise you will be prompted to enter your 1rm for that exercise if you haven't done that yet.

<img src="https://github.com/ipruter/WorkoutMaker/blob/main/Images/Screenshot_20230604-185018-005.png" height="50%" width="50%" >


You don't have to know your 1RM, just enter a weight you can do to failure for a certain amount of reps and it will calculate it for you. In most cases, you will only enter in desired reps and sets and leave the weight form blank. It will calculate how much bar weight you can do based on your 1RM, so do not include your body weight for exercises like pull ups, squats, and crunches. Only put weight youve added like bar weight, dipbelt weight, or any other plates you are holding. Otherwise just put zero for weight. In the case you want to do something like 50 reps of squats but your body weight prevents you from going that high in reps, it will set any weight you put to 0 and adjust the reps to the amount you can do with just body weight. For example it could change the 50 reps you entered to 37 if 50 is just not possible for your current squat strength, at your current weight.

In cases like flipping tires where you want to target something like 8 reps, you will very unlikely find a tire at the weight where you max out at exactly 8 reps. In this case, enter in the weight of the tire and leave the reps blank and it will calculate the maximum amount of reps you can do at the weight available

Go through each day of the week you intend to work out and fill them in with exercises.

Once a workout is created you don't have to go any further than the home screen to reference it when it comes time to work out. The exercise you need to do for that day only will be displayed on the home screen for your convenience.

When you are ready to I increase weight for a particular exercise select the "get max button weight", find the exercise, and hit overload. 

<img src="https://github.com/ipruter/WorkoutMaker/blob/main/Images/Screenshot_20230604-185309-616.png" height="50%" width="50%" >

This will increase the weight of that exercise across all of your workouts and rep ranges of that exercise to save you the bother of having to go to each instance of bench press, for example, and calculate a 5% increase for each one.

You can also set max weight yourself by pressing the max weight button then set max weight it will bring up the same pop up asking how many reps you can do a certain amount of weight for. The program uses the 1RM to calculate weight for a desired workout intensity. The utility of this feature is calculating weight across various repetitions. In any practice of resistance training lifters will use a multitude of ranges of volume and intensity to prevent plateaus in their training. As you mix up the amount of repetitions you do, the program will find an appropriate amount of corresponding weight.

Another use case would be finding the 1RM at a weight you are more comfortable with. Let's say you intend on training squats at an intensity of 89% 1RM but you aren't comfortable attempting 5 repetitions to near failure. You can push 20 repetitions to near failure with a much more manageable amount of weight. The program will calculate an accurate weight for 89% intensity when you enter in 5 reps but you can train at a relative intensity of 3 reps to mitigate injury at such high intensity. 

Under get max weight were exercises are listed, you can also add your own if there is an unconventional exercise or varient not listed. This will only prompt you for the name of the exercise and a modifier.

<img src="https://github.com/ipruter/WorkoutMaker/blob/main/Images/Screenshot_20230604-185426-502.png" height="50%" width="50%" >

The modifier is just the percentage of bodywieght that is included in the resistance of the exercise. For example, a pull up includes 100% of your body weight, and only 72% of your body weight is lifted in a squat, aslo factoring in leverage. you would put 1 for full bodyweight, 0 in non of your modyweight and a specific decimal number in a format like 0.5 for anything that includes partial bodyweight. If modifier is left untouched, it defaults to 0 which is the case for most exercises.

The home screen also provides a button to change your bodyweight when you need to. Your bodyweight is a key peice of information to leverage the percision the workout optomiser has to offer. Exercises such as pushups and pull ups are largely regarded as calisthenic, however the calisthenic element of a squat is an important factor, and is regularly overlooked. For example, take a 160 lb. person with a 300 lb. max squat of bar weight. If they squat in the strength range of 90% max or 270 lbs. one week, and hypertrophy range of 70% max or 210 lbs. another; they realistically can’t perform either at those rep ranges for that intensity. This is because the real weight they are moving at that intensity is 373.68 and 290.64 lbs. which comes to 258.48 and 175.44 lbs. of bar weight. To work out appropriately at those desired ranges of intensity, the person would have to play around with weight through trial and error to find the appropriate weight and repeat the process whenever they change intensity or overload.  Knowing the body weight allows the workout optimizer to always find the precise amount weight and reps to meet the users needs with none of the hassle.

After a few months your body will stop responding the same way it did when you started. This plateau can be avoided by periodically changing up workouts, weight, sets, reps, rest period, and tempo. You could rotate variation of exercises you do or have multiple workouts of the same exercises that just alter volume and intensity. Bodybuilders and strongmen will typically train the entire body throughout a week's cycle typically only training a muscle group once or sometimes twice a week. For bodybuilding, time under tension is key with a Slow rep range of 8-12 wich is generally regarded as ideal. However, higher reps at a faster tempo will also achieve the same amount of time under tension. Alternating workouts with different rep ranges and or tempo and even throwing a little strength intensity in once in a while will also stave off plateaus. Powerlifting and olympic weight lifting is a little more structured because unlike bodybuilding, strength training has a hypertrophy phase that is later transferred into a strength phase and then an actualization phase. Linear, undulating, and block periodization are common ways to structure a workout where volume and intensity fluctuate throughout the training cycle to optimally yield a high increase in 1RM through strategic phasing of hypertrophy, strength, recovery, and technique. To build any type of periodization routines, make a workout for each micro cycle and label it something like undulating periodization week 1, then undulating periodization week 2, and so on. In this case you will repeat primary compound lifts multiple times throughout each week changing reps intensity, sets, or tempo.
